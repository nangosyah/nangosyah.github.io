# **Welcome**

After 6 years of employment, I decided to take a two-year break to pursue my Master’s in Statistics and Data Science. The past few years have been an immersive learning experience, allowing me grow my analytical and statistical skills while diving deep into the health sciences field. But let me take you back to where it all started.

### The Start: Research, Data Analytics, and Business Advisory

My professional journey started with me working as a Research Associate at Inachee. Where I worked with a team that **conducted business sector analysis, financial appraisals, business plans and feasibility studies**. It was here that I developed a passion for translating data into actionable business insights. This role introduced me to **data management**, as I was responsible for overseeing the **curating and development of a cloud-based data bank** where the company would market and sale its research assets to customers, and I began to understand the power of data-driven decisions.

From Inachee, I transitioned into EnerGrow, a startup that focuses on asset financing for SMEs in Uganda. Over the years, I held various roles within the company, from **Research and Data Analyst to Expansion Manager** and ultimately a **Research and Development Consultant**. I was fortunate to lead the design of a pilot asset financing loan program and manage stakeholder reporting and partnerships on projects financed by organizations like [EEP](https://eepafrica.org/), [Doen Foundation](www.doen.nl), [GIZ](https://www.giz.de/en/worldwide/310.html), [MECs Co.](www.mecs.org.uk), [IMEU](https://www.snv.org/project/inclusive-markets-energy-efficiency-uganda-imeu), [EnDev](https://endev.info/countries/uganda/), [CEI](https://cei-africa.com/) and [Rockefeller Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/africa/). These roles shaped my expertise in managing and analyzing data, building reports, and managing projects. I was able to work across multiple functions, helping the company grow and expand to new regions in Uganda.

### A New Chapter: My Master’s in Data Science

Despite the exciting projects I was involved in, I felt the urge to dive deeper into the technical side of data analysis. That’s why I took a two-year break to pursue my Master’s degree in Statistics and Data Science at the [University of Hasselt](https://www.uhasselt.be/nl) in Belgium. My interest in health sciences was sparked by the growing role of data sciences and statistics in solving some of the most complex biological problems through data. I wanted to be part of that innovation and bring my experience in research and analytics into this cutting-edge field.

### Looking Forward: Open to New Opportunities

Now that I’m nearing the end of my Master’s, I am more than ready to apply my expanded knowledge in **data science, statistics, and bioinformatics**. I’m looking for opportunities that will allow me to continue **learning, growing, and making an impact**, especially in health sciences or any other sector where data can drive meaningful change. I believe the blend of my past experience with my new expanded knowledge can offer unique perspectives and solutions.

This blog will serve as a platform for me to share some of the projects that interest me and what I have worked on, insights on data science, and my journey of navigating this ever-evolving field. Whether you’re here to learn more about data science applications or you’re simply curious about its application, I hope you find something interesting.
