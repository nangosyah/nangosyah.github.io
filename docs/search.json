    "text": "I’m passionate about using data to drive impactful solutions. Data has always intrigued me—how it can inform decisions, drive business strategies, and shape meaningful outcomes.\nI’ve worked with clients to understand their business needs, secure funding, and navigate rural and peri-urban markets, always finding fulfillment in the process of research, project management and fieldwork.\nOver the years, I’ve applied my skills in sectors like agriculture, renewable energy, and micro-finance, consistently focused on solving real-world problems and fostering growth.\nOutside of work, I’m a big music and sports fan, with a particular love for Formula One and football."
