I’m passionate about using data to drive impactful solutions. Data has always intrigued me: how it can inform decisions, drive business strategies, and shape meaningful outcomes.

I’ve worked with clients to understand their business needs, secure funding, and navigate rural and peri-urban markets, always finding fulfillment in the process of research, project management and fieldwork.

Over the years, I’ve applied my skills in sectors like agriculture, renewable energy, and micro-finance, consistently focused on solving real-world problems and fostering growth.

Outside of work, I’m a big music and sports fan, with a particular love for Formula One and football.
