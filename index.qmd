I'm passionate about data-driven impact, with experience in research, project management, and client relations across agriculture, renewable energy, and micro-finance.

I enjoy translating ideas into action, delivering meaningful end-to-end programs, solving complex challenges with cross-functional teams, fostering collaboration through engaging meetings, and building shared value relationships with communities, partners, and donors/investors.

Outside of work, I enjoy Music, Football, Formula One and a lot of other sports.\
\
At the moment, I am exploring roles that focus on:

📌 Health Sciences: research, data analytics, bioinformatics\
📌 Project delivery within development sectors\
📌 Innovation: pilots, initiatives, processes\
📌 Strategy & transformation\
📌 Data Management

\
I am also open to interesting conversations about where I can add value!\
