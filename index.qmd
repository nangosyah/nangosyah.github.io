**What I do**

Translate data into decisions. I design decision support tools, apply statistical and Machine Learning methods, and lead delivery so insights become programs that work, informing strategy, business cases, and executive decisions.

**Where I’ve worked**

Impact-focused settings across clean energy, micro-finance, socio-economic research, and start-ups working with cross-functional teams and securing multi-partner support to scale solutions.

Outside of work, I enjoy Music, Football, Formula One and a lot of other sports.

I’m always open to interesting conversations about where I can add value.\
